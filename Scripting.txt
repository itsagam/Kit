C#
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
uREPL:
Highly featured packed, with in-game inspectors
Full autocompletion for commands
Really well-written code
Uses Mono.CSharp.Evaluator, which does not seem to work on iOS

CSharp-Interpreter-for-Unity-3D:
Uses System.CodeDom.Compiler/Microsoft.CSharp for code compilation
Does not seem to work on iOS

csharp-eval-unity3d:
Evaluates basic C# expressions
Custom interpreter
Works on iOS

ILRuntime:
Is a C# compiled library interpreter
Code has to be compiled before use
High-level functionality is very barebones, although well-written
Does not support injection of any kind
Works on iOS

Lua
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
xLua:
Have to invoke C# methods in Lua using "CS."
Lots of high-level functionalities
Hotfix functionality does voodoo (https://github.com/Tencent/xLua/blob/master/Assets/XLua/Doc/Hotfix_EN.md) to allow to change C# methods (create a property somewhere marked with [Hotfix] attribute that returns all modifiable classes)
To enable hotfix funtionality you have to inject project .dll after every recompile with xLua->Hotfix in Editor
Both static-binding via code generation and reflection supported
A bit more consistent and cleaner than xLua
Maintained by Tencent

ToLua:
Run Unity in Administrator mode for the first time. It tries to copy Unity.Cecil.dll from Unity folder to its project directory, whose references its missing.
Delete InjectionBridgeEditorInfo.xml
Good performance (https://blog.csdn.net/u011467512/article/details/72716376)
Supports method replacing/pre-inject/post-inject (https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/35124260) by doing some voodoo
To enable it you have to inject project .dll after every recompile with Lua->Inject All
Uses static-binding

SLua:
Lean and high-performance
Not much high-level functionality
Does not support injection
Uses static-binding
